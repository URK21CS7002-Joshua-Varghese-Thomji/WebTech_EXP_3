            <h2>Drone Technology for Agricultural Mission</h2>
            <p>
              Agriculture being the backbone of Indian economy, it has to be
              supported with emerging tools and one such tool is drone
              technology.
              Drones are being used for GIS mapping and other related works,
              having a potential to solve several problems in Agriculture. KITS
              has made it a mission to develop Drones for scouting lands and
              crops, inspecting weeds, monitoring and management of crops and
              monitoring and managing the grazing areas and health of livestock.
